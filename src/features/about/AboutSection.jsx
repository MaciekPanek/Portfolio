            My journey with programming began in June 2022, I picked it up out
            of boredom after work, at first it was just a hobby, but after six
            months I decided to make it my future career... and here I am.

            I love trying new technologies and programming languages, I started
            with Python and Java, then I fell in love with web dev, and now I am
            carving my way into digital design and fullstack technologies so I
            can expand my carrer spectrum.

            I really enjoy finding new things and ideas that I am able to
            implement into my daily life, whether it is for work, or my own
            benefit. It also gives an andvantage in other interests that I
            picked up, like astronomy or aerospace technology that I like to
            explore.
